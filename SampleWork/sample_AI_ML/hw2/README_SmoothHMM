How to compile the file:
     Before running the program, make sure you have installed numpy    
     In your Term, type "python SmoothHMM.py"

How to run the program:
     Follow the instruction of the program, an example may as
     following:

     n = 5
     Input the evidence sequence:1 0 1 0 1

     Then the program will give the result:

     P(X_1=T|e1:5) = 0.38639
     P(X_2=T|e1:5) = 0.32400
     P(X_3=T|e1:5) = 0.32728
     P(X_4=T|e1:5) = 0.40699
     P(X_5=T|e1:5) = 0.71536


What does the program do:
     Compute the smoothed estimates of X_t , t = 1, ..., n 
     given evidence e_{1:T}, and it will print 
     P(X_t=T|e1:n)  for all t 

     It basically follows the algorithm described in AIMA
