How to compile the file:
     Before running the program, make sure you have installed numpy    
     In your Term, type "python MaxSeq.py"

How to run the program:
     Follow the instruction of the program, an example may as
     following:

     n = 4
     Input the evidence sequence: 1 0 1 0

     Then the program will give the result:
     
     [1, 0, 1, 0]
     

What does the program do:
     Find the most likely sequence of states X_{1:t} given evidence e_{1:t}
     Detailed implementation could be found in the source code
     It basically follows the idea in AIMA
