How to compile the file:
     In your Term, type "python GibbsRain.py"

How to run the program:
     program would ask you to type "sumSteps" as the times of iteration,
     type it and the program will print the value of P(r|s,w)

What does the program do:
     Using Gibbs sampling to produce the approximate value of P(r|s,w)
     The source code is well-documented, detail explanation could be found
     in the source file
