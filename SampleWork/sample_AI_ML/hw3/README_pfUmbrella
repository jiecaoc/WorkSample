How to run:
python pfUmbrella.py numSamples numSteps evidence_sequence


Example:
python pfUmbrella.py 100 10 1111100000


Output:
P(R_10 = T|u_1:10) = 0.0400
P(R_10 = F|u_1:10) = 0.9600

P(R_10 = T|u_1:10) = 0.0500
P(R_10 = F|u_1:10) = 0.9500

P(R_10 = T|u_1:10) = 0.0800
P(R_10 = F|u_1:10) = 0.9200

P(R_10 = T|u_1:10) = 0.0200
P(R_10 = F|u_1:10) = 0.9800

P(R_10 = T|u_1:10) = 0.0300
P(R_10 = F|u_1:10) = 0.9700

P(R_10 = T|u_1:10) = 0.0700
P(R_10 = F|u_1:10) = 0.9300

P(R_10 = T|u_1:10) = 0.0700
P(R_10 = F|u_1:10) = 0.9300

P(R_10 = T|u_1:10) = 0.0400
P(R_10 = F|u_1:10) = 0.9600

P(R_10 = T|u_1:10) = 0.0100
P(R_10 = F|u_1:10) = 0.9900

P(R_10 = T|u_1:10) = 0.1000
P(R_10 = F|u_1:10) = 0.9000

After running 10 time, the varience of estimates is 0.00073

PS: This code may not implemented in the most efficient way, if numSamples = 1000,
    it may take around 10 secs to get the result.
    Basically, I'm not using the best way to implement Weighted_Sample(N, S, W), 
    I just use the most simple way
