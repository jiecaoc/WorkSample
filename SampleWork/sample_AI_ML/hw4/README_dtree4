#How to run:
    type command as follow:
       python dtree4.py
    make sure the data "dataset.csv" is in the same dir

#What does the code do:
    1.train a decision tree through the data
    2.print out the decision tree
    2.calculate the training dataset error
    3.calculate the LOOCV error

#Sample out put:
The tree structure after learning from all example:
Pat 's children ==============
None F
Full Hun
Some T
Hun 's children ==============
T Type
F F
Type 's children ==============
Burger T
Thai Fri
French T
Italian F
Fri 's children ==============
T T
F F
Training Set Error Rate: 0.0


Now do LOOCV :
leave Example 1 out: real class - T ,by DTree - T
leave Example 2 out: real class - F ,by DTree - T
leave Example 3 out: real class - T ,by DTree - T
leave Example 4 out: real class - T ,by DTree - F
leave Example 5 out: real class - F ,by DTree - T
leave Example 6 out: real class - T ,by DTree - T
leave Example 7 out: real class - F ,by DTree - F
leave Example 8 out: real class - T ,by DTree - T
leave Example 9 out: real class - F ,by DTree - T
leave Example 10 out: real class - F ,by DTree - T
leave Example 11 out: real class - F ,by DTree - F
leave Example 12 out: real class - T ,by DTree - F
LOOCV Error Rate: 0.5
