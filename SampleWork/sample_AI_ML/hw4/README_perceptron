#How to run:
     type:
	python perceptron.py
     make sure "dataset.csv" should be in the same dir

#What does it do:
     1.create a perceptron with N inputs, several hidden layers and M outputs,
       in this case, N = 10, M = 1, and no hidden layer
     2.test training data
     3.LOOCV test

I have written a general class BPNN, which make it trival to create BPNN of ant dimension.
